# üõéÔ∏è Bellman

Make beautiful and informative in-app announcements to your users.

Bellman was built while trying to minimise dependencies on third-party packages, which is why
it only uses essential packages to render markdown, or to access shared preferences.

## Getting started

TODO: List prerequisites and provide or point to information on how to
start using the package.

## Usage

Just wrap your root widget with the `BellmanWidget` to provide the functionality anywhere in your app.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

### What can I use it for?

Bellman comes ready with a few preconfigured widgets out of the box. Just provide some data
and you don't have to worry about how it's displayed to your users.

- Changelog
- Text/Markdown
- Image carousel
- Custom

#### Changelog

When building an app, it's not unusual to update your users on any new developments such as features, bug fixes, improvements, etc. `BellmanChangelog` helps with that by making it easy to display those changes separated by category. 

#### Markdown
#### 

### Customisation

## Additional information

TODO: Tell users more about the package: where to find more information, how to
contribute to the package, how to file issues, what response they can expect
from the package authors, and more.
